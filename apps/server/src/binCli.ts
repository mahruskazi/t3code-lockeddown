/**
 * [fork:lockdown] Upstream registers a `triage` command that seeds a local
 * coding agent to read the state database, provider event log, and terminal
 * logs, then file a public issue on pingdotgg/t3code. On a machine holding
 * proprietary code that evidence is the confidential material, and upstream's
 * redaction step covers credentials and home paths but not source, prompts, or
 * repo identities. This fork does not register it.
 *
 * [fork:lockdown] Upstream also registers `update`, which downloads a
 * pingdotgg/t3code GitHub release archive and runs it. This fork runs only
 * builds it provisioned (invariant 2), so it does not register that either.
 * `cli/update.ts` stays because `uninstall` reuses its launcher helpers.
 * Tripwire: binCli.test.ts asserts `triage` and `update` are absent from the CLI.
